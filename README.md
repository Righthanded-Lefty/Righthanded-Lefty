- 👋 Hi, I’m @Righthanded-Lefty, currently a self-employed oral-interpreter.
- 👀 I'm spending most of my leisure time on Tennis & Vocal Synthesizer.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to put those on-line, the 1st step being creating a WebSite about Tennis Techniques.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on UX and UI design.
